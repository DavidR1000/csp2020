		<b1> This project is designed so the user gets to choose the majority of the colors used in their imaginary world. The users gets to pick the colors of the house (which includes roof, door, and windows) and the garden (which includes 2 flowers, a ladybug, and a spider. The program starts off with drawing a background. The background is composed of green grass, a blue sky, a yellow sun, and white clouds. The program then goes on to draw the house with the colors the user inputted. After drawing the house the program then draws the garden. It starts the garden off by drawing the 2 flowers with the colors the user choose, then the ladybug with the color the user choose, and finally ends the garden with drawing the spider with the colors the user choose. The final part of the program is having the object the user chooses move accros the screen. If the user chooses a bee, then the program imports a photo of a bee and has it fly from one flower to the next one. If the user chooses plane, then a photo of an airplane is imported and plane flies across the sky from one end to the other. Finally, if the user chooses a hot air balloon, then a a photo of a hot balloon is imported and flies from the ground to the sky and sits right underneath the sun.  </b1>
